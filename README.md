## Description

The "Livable Cities Score" package is a collection of checklists and tools used to evaluate if a particular building is within a zone that is pedestrian friendly. It includes comprehensive checklists that can be used to evaluate whether a building has amenities within walking distance and if the surrounding area is conducive to walking and pedestrian safety.

## Usage

The checklists are currently presented only as a static form, that needs to be filled and calculated manually. An automated Excel spreadsheet will follow.

The checklists provides a comprehensive list of amenities that are commonly desired to be within walking distance from an apartment building, such as grocery stores, schools, public transportation stops, parks, pharmacies, and more. Besides amenities, the checklists also include a set of criteria that can be used to assess the walkability and pedestrian-friendliness of the surrounding area of a building. The criteria cover aspects such as sidewalk availability, sidewalk quality, street lighting, crosswalks, traffic volume, and more. Users can evaluate each criterion based on the conditions in the building's neighborhood and provide scores or comments accordingly.
