## General guidelines for scoring
* **3 points** - basic necessities, such as food, medicine, and transport. Items are used daily or weekly.
* **2 points** - secondary necessities, such as entertainment, socializing, and recreational. Items are used a few times a month.
* **1 points** - improvements if basic necessities are met (e.g. better sidewalks or larger stores), luxury items, specialized hobby products, etc. Items are used a few times a year.

## Distance-based scoring.

Scoring based on distance is calculated as the base point multiplier times the distance score (DS), generated using the rules from below. For example, for a venue that is 7 minutes away with a base multiplier of 3, the final score will be 0.5 x 3pt = 1.5pt.
* [<= 5 minutes walking] = 1 (full base points)
* [> 5 minutes walking (and) <= 10 minutes walking] = 0.5 (half base points)
* [> 10 minutes walking (and) <= 20 minutes walking] = 0.25 (quarter base points)
